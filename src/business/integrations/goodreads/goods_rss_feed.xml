&quot;<br />When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is "less than meets the eye." <br /><br />At first glance, his work seems thoroughly researched, even visionary at times. Beginning with a few maverick, counter-intuitive insights, he often ends with an affirmation of consensus, but it is a consensus that has been broadened by investigation and enriched by nuance.<br /><br />On second look, however, I'm no longer sure any of this is true. What first appeared to be new insights are nothing but familiar landmarks, previously unrecognizable because of the adoption of a deliberately mannered perspective; even the once apparent breadth and nuance now seem triumphs of language over logic, the apparent inevitability of his arguments an illusion conjured by the spell of his limpid prose.<br /><br />Take one small example from "Outliers." With a flurry of standardized test statistics, Gladwell makes the case that the traditional summer vacation--however rewarding it may be for the middle class--is just not working for the poor. (I'll concede the point, for the sake of argument, but any high school teacher will tell you how suspect conclusions drawn from such statistics can be.) He then presents a sustained anecdote about a successful all-year-round secondary school in a poor neighborhood. His conclusion? We should go to school year round.<br /><br /> Sounds reasonable, right? But what about a more obvious solution: as a society we could decide to work together so that summer can be a learning experience for the poor by instituting a myriad of basketball camps, music camps, art camps, chess camps, traditional summer camps, etc., held at schools, community centers, and city parks, and staffed by college students, artists and teachers from the neighborhood. <br /><br />Gladwell often reminds me of the last panel of a Dilbert cartoon: two panels of plain-speaking criticism, followed by one panel of resignation. And no real insight, no real hope for the future.&quot;

&quot;What is with all these 4 star+ rated thrillers being so awful? <br /><br />I mean, I get that this book is quite compelling, especially with the use of short chapters and the psychiatrist's tape recordings to keep the pacing up... but, come on, go back and reread the first few chapters after finishing this book and tell me the twist makes sense. Because it really doesn't.<br /><br />So many people have recommended McFadden to me. I actually went and picked up this book and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60556912.The_Housemaid" title="The Housemaid by Freida McFadden" rel="nofollow noopener">The Housemaid</a> at the same time, but now I'm reluctant to start her other stuff because parts of this were laughably bad.<br /><br />It's hard to say which was the worst thing. The repetition of the same thing over and over?<br /><blockquote>
  <i>It was a worrying reminder of the fact that I’ve only known my husband for a little over a year.<br /><br />It’s yet another reminder that I’ve only known this man for a little over a year.</i>
</blockquote><br />The way the author hammered us over the head with a red herring to the point that I felt a little insulted?<br /><br /><a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[Tricia discovers tapes of sessions with "EJ", a psychopath and wine connoisseur with a "familiar" voice. Her husband is called Ethan, is a wine connoisseur, has a temper sometimes, has no known friends or family and, she notes, she doesn't know him very well at all 🙄 <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />Or the ludicrous twists that <i>may</i> have worked if this book had been written in third person, but in first person are utterly absurd?<br /><br />Also, the author does this weird thing where a character will say something via dialogue, then the narrator will make an extremely obvious observation about it in their inner monologue. For example:<br /><blockquote>
  <i>“Don’t let him manipulate you,” Ethan says. “He isn’t a good person. He killed [spoiler]. He killed one of the people closest to him. What kind of person does that?”<br /><br />Ethan doesn’t have a clue that [spoiler] isn’t the one who killed [spoiler].</i>
</blockquote><br />No shit! She does this multiple times.<br /><br />In some ways, two stars feels generous, but then I did blast through this with a need to know what the hell was going on. Not many authors manage to keep the suspense going like that.&quot;

        tbf I was hooked at first, was ignoring plot holes and cringe worthy passages here and there. I mean it's fun. I hated the book by the major plot twist. forced, disappointing.
